MediGo is an interactive medical appointment booking web application that allows patients to book appointments, rate and comment on their doctors based on the treatment they received.
In order to make the website run smoothly, first the hospital management should register and add doctors to the database, and set up their working schedule, respectively.
After that, patients can browse through the hospitals and doctors, choose as they please and book appointments.
